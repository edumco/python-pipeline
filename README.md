## Why a pipeline on Docker
Although several pipeline solutions exist, they are too complex for small projects. With this solution you just need a docker file.  

## Built Image
A docker image of this project is automaticly built on Docker Hub. They are not meant to use as it is, but to validate if all tools are correct so you can use it in your project.
